# Cypher Project

Cypher is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to facilitate schema conversion between different formats, including GraphQL, JSON, Proto3, SQL, XSD, and YAML. This directory serves as the core of the Cypher project, containing all the source code and related components required for the tool's functionality.

## Project Structure Overview

The Cypher project is organized into several key directories and files:

```
/cypher
├── cmd/                # CLI commands
│   └── cypher/
│       ├── main.go
│       ├── convert.go
│       ├── list.go
│       └── version.go
├── internal/           # Internal logic for parsing and converting
│   ├── parser/
│   │   ├── graphql.go
│   │   ├── json.go
│   │   ├── proto.go
│   │   ├── sql.go
│   │   ├── xsd.go
│   │   └── yaml.go
│   └── converter/

│   ├── example.graphql
│   ├── example.json
│   ├── example.proto
│   ├── example.sql
│   ├── example.yaml
│   └── example.xsd

```

## Directories and Files

### 1. `cmd/`

This directory contains the main CLI commands that power the Cypher tool. Each command is implemented as a separate file under the `cypher/` subdirectory:

- **`main.go`**: The entry point of the CLI application.
- **`convert.go`**: Handles schema conversion from one format to another.
- **`list.go`**: Lists all supported schema formats.
- **`version.go`**: Displays the current version of the Cypher tool.

### 2. `internal/`

The `internal` directory holds the core logic for parsing and converting schema files. It is organized into two subdirectories:

- **`parser/`**: Contains files for parsing each schema type (GraphQL, JSON, Proto3, SQL, XSD, and YAML).
- **`converter/`**: Handles the conversion logic between different schema formats.

### 3. `pkg/`

The `pkg` directory contains reusable data structures that represent different schema formats. This directory is organized into the `schema/` package, which defines types for each schema format:

- **`graphql_schema.go`**
- **`json_schema.go`**
- **`proto_schema.go`**
- **`sql_schema.go`**
- **`xsd_schema.go`**
- **`yaml_schema.go`**

These shared data structures are used by the parsers and converters for handling schema representations consistently across the tool.

### 4. `samples/`

The `samples` directory includes example files for each schema type. These files are useful for testing the tool's functionality and demonstrating how different schema formats are handled:

- **example.graphql**: Sample GraphQL schema
- **example.json**: Sample JSON schema
- **example.proto**: Sample Proto3 schema
- **example.sql**: Sample SQL schema
- **example.yaml**: Sample YAML schema
- **example.xsd**: Sample XSD schema

### 5. `docs/`

The `docs` directory contains detailed documentation about the Cypher project. It includes information on how to use the tool, how it works, and how to contribute to its development. For more details, check the [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md).

### 6. `go.mod` and `go.sum`

These files define the module dependencies for the Cypher project. They are generated and managed by the Go module system to ensure that all dependencies are properly versioned and consistent.

## Getting Started

To set up and use Cypher, please refer to the installation instructions in the main [README.md](../README.md) file located at the project root.

## Development Workflow

### Building the CLI Tool

To build the Cypher CLI tool, run the following command:

```bash
go build -o cypher ./cmd/cypher
```

### Running the Tool

You can test the CLI tool using commands like:

```bash
./cypher list
./cypher convert --input-format=json --output-format=sql --input-file=samples/example.json --output-file=output.sql
./cypher version
```
