## Introduction

Cypher is a command-line tool that facilitates the conversion of schema files between various formats like GraphQL, JSON, Proto3, SQL, XSD, and YAML. The goal of Cypher's documentation is to provide clear guidance on how to use the tool, how to contribute to its development, and how to integrate it into different environments.

## Project Overview

The Cypher project is organized into the following main components:

- **CLI Commands**: Commands to interact with the Cypher tool via the terminal.
- **Internal Logic**: Parsing and conversion logic for each schema type.
- **Data Structures**: Definitions of schema representations used by Cypher.
- **Samples**: Example files demonstrating the supported schema formats.

## Setup and Installation

For detailed instructions on setting up and installing Cypher, please refer to the main [README.md](../README.md) file in the project root.

## Usage Guidelines

This section provides examples and use cases for each CLI command:

- **`cypher list`**: Lists all supported schema formats.
- **`cypher convert`**: Converts a schema file from one format to another.
- **`cypher version`**: Displays the current version of the Cypher tool.

Refer to the [Usage](../README.md#usage) section in the main README file for specific command examples.

## Schema Conversion

Detailed guides on how Cypher handles conversions between the following formats:

- **GraphQL**: How GraphQL schema is converted to other formats and vice versa.
- **JSON**: Converting JSON schema to SQL, YAML, and other formats.
- **Proto3**: Guidelines for converting Proto3 definitions to various schema types.
- **SQL**: Conversion of SQL schema to structured formats like JSON, GraphQL, etc.
- **XSD**: XML Schema conversion processes and limitations.
- **YAML**: Converting YAML schema to other formats using Cypher.

Documentation on these conversions can be found in their respective files within this directory.

## Development Guide

The development guide contains information for contributors and developers who wish to enhance or extend Cypher. Topics covered include:

- **Project Structure**: Understanding the organization of the codebase.
- **Coding Standards**: Best practices for writing Go code in Cypher.
- **Adding New Schema Types**: How to add support for new schema formats to Cypher.
- **Testing**: Guidelines for writing unit tests and integration tests for Cypher.
